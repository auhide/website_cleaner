Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican and former US ambassador under George W. Bush when asked about Giuliani. Rooney noted "more things keep coming up in the investigation" and the investigation should look at who "who else was involved."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"They called Watergate a witch hunt," Rooney noted.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Another Republican House member, who sits on one of the committees leading the impeachment probe, told CNN: "We have to see what his involvement is."</div><div class="zn-body__read-more"><div class="read-more-button"><div class="read-more-link" id="js-body-read-more">Read More</div></div></div><div class="zn-body__read-all"><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Texas Rep. , who is the top Republican member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said of Giuliani when asked if he had concerns: "I know he's been subpoenaed for documents, and I fully anticipate he's going to be subpoenaed as a witness. I'm going to reserve judgment until we hear from him."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Asked if he were unnerved at all about Giuliani's role, McCaul said, "There's a lot that we don't know about."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">House Republican lawmakers spoke to CNN before Giuliani's attorney on Tuesday afternoon saying the President's personal lawyer would not comply with the subpoena issued by House Democrats as part of their impeachment inquiry. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But what has come to light had become a source of concern for some Republicans -- namely the effort by Giuliani to to probe the Bidens and his effort to smear the then-US ambassador to Ukraine, . Added to that was the revealing testimony from a former top Trump Russia adviser, , who sources say testified that then-national security adviser John Bolton referred to Giuliani as a "hand grenade" who was going to "blow everyone up."</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Still, many Republicans continue to downplay Giulani's role.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Rep. Scott Perry, who has sat in on the impeachment proceedings, noted that he is a "private citizen" when asked about Giuliani's efforts.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">"When they contacted him, he could say yes or he could say no," said Perry, a Republican from Pennsylvania.</div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">But some Republican aides say members are growing uneasy with Giuliani's role and closeness to the President in light of the recent allegations that are piling up against the President's personal lawyer. It's not as much about the substance of what is alleged -- although members are holding their breath about if more comes to light -- but it is about his style: his brashness, his unpredictability and his ability to show up on one cable news show after another without much warning. </div><div class="zn-body__paragraph">Aides say that members are frustrated with the biggest flashpoint is that Giuliani is causing headaches.  </div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></article></div>
